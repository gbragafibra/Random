    "One of the central interests comes from the prediction and reconstruction of time-series. A very nice characteristic of in vitro/in vivo systems, is that they have been under the \"evolutionary test\" for a reasonable amount of time, such that emerging from resource scarce conditions, majority of times, if not all, a bet-hedging scheme appears, along with majority of substrates in this respective system being multi-functional. This out of itself is pressed by a necessity not to optimize for what we perceive to be a single metric, but to minmax for an enormous set of them. After that, what would be an individual with its own incentives, is usually merged with other ones of the same scale, resulting in larger-scale networks that inherently constrain the state-space exploration of its constituents. \n",
    "All of this to say: There's a lot of non-linear dynamics to be harvested and to be used as a reservoir for time-series prediction. "
